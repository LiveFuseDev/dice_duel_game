# 🎲 Dice Duel Challenge

To practice what I've learned so far in Python, including input handling, conditional statements, random number generation, and basic print formatting.

## 🧠 Objective:
Create a game where **you and the computer** each roll a 6-sided die. The one with the **higher roll wins**.

## 🛠️ Requirements:

- Print a welcome message.
- Take basic user input to start the game.
- Use `random.randint(1, 6)` to roll a die for both the user and the computer.
- Store values in variables and display the result of each roll.
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to compare the results:
  - If the user’s roll is higher → **you win!**
  - If the computer’s roll is higher → **computer wins!**
  - If they are equal → **it’s a draw!**

## ✅ Concepts Practiced:

- Printing formatted text
- Getting input from the user
- Using the `random` module
- Generating random numbers
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for logic
- Variables and comparison operators
